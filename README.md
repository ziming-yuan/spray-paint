# Spray Paint .NET WPF Assignment

### Incomplete steps:
* Allow users to save the changes and open the image again to edit and update the spray.
* Thoughts: perhaps save the image and the spray as separate files, but doesn't look neat for users.

### Caveats:
* When image is large, spray and erase buttons may fail to work.
